# Apigee Source
Have you ever felt like:
* Working with APIs is too hard
* Authentication is terribly annoying
* Making my first successful API call should be faster

So do we, which is why we built [Apigee Source](http://blog.apigee.com/detail/apigee_source_twitter_api/) and the [JavaScript framework](http://apigee.github.com/Apigee-Source-for-JavaScript/) that makes the magic happen.

We're looking for collaborators to contribute on a contract basis, so [get in touch](mailto:source@apigee.com) if you want to build a better future.
